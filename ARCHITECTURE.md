| 🧠 Strategy Viewer  | StrategyManager          | View + trigger strategies         |
| 📊 Orders & Holdings| SmartConnectClient       | Portfolio / open positions        |
| 📍 Notifications    | Events from WebSocket or strategy | Real-time alerts & updates |


## 📐 Why This Layout Follows SOLID Principles

| Principle                 | Applied Design Practice |
|--------------------------|-------------------------|
| **S - Single Responsibility** | Each module handles one responsibility:<br>• `websocket_client.py` manages only the WebSocket lifecycle<br>• Observers handle specific data reactions like EMA, order placement, or charting |
| **O - Open/Closed**         | System behavior is configurable via YAML and observers — add new observers without modifying existing code |
| **L - Liskov Substitution** | All observers implement a uniform `update(data)` interface, allowing clean substitution of behavior |
| **I - Interface Segregation** | Components depend only on what they use:<br>• YAML defines configuration contracts<br>• CLI and API interact through clean boundaries |
| **D - Dependency Inversion** | High-level modules (CLI/API) depend on abstractions (observer interface, YAML config), not low-level concrete implementations |


# SOLID Principles Review

## 🧱 S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
**Each module should have one reason to change.**

### ✅ What you're doing well:
- The `observer` folder seems to group observation-related logic (like alerts, charts, indicators).
- The `core` folder separates foundational logic (e.g., session and config loading).

### 💡 Suggestions:
- `observer/database.py` and `observer/mongodaba.py` might overlap in responsibility. Consider unifying or clearly separating their concerns.
- `send_live_data_to_front_end.py` in `frontend` might deserve its own `core/streaming.py` or `services/streaming.py` if it has broader responsibilities than just UI support.

---

## 🏗 O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
**Modules should be open for extension but closed for modification.**

### 💡 Suggestions:
- Use interfaces or base classes (abstract base classes or protocols) in `observer/base_observer.py` and `bracket_order`/`normal_order` to allow adding new order types without changing existing ones.
- Strategy files (`strategy_loader.py`, `strategies.yml`) might benefit from a strategy pattern where each strategy type is a class adhering to a common interface.

---

## 🔌 L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
**Subclasses or derived classes should be substitutable for their base classes.**

### 💡 Suggestions:
- Ensure that any subclass of `base_observer.py` (e.g., `alert`, `limit_order_trigger`) can be used interchangeably. Avoid assumptions in the parent class that only certain subclasses satisfy.
- If `price_prediction.py` relies on subclassing, validate that it respects the LSP in both logic and return types.

---

## 🔄 I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
**Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use.**

### 💡 Suggestions:
- If any of your observers implement large interfaces (e.g., too many methods in `base_observer`), consider splitting them into smaller, more specific interfaces like `AlertObserver`, `ChartObserver`, etc.

---

## 🏭 D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
**Depend on abstractions, not concretions.**

### 💡 Suggestions:
- Use dependency injection for `core/session.py`, `core/websocket_client.py`, and database access layers. This would also make `init_db.py`, `server.py`, and `main.py` easier to test and maintain.
- For the `observer` components or strategy loading, abstract the data loading part so it can switch between YAML, JSON, or even a database with minimal changes.

### ✅ Example: Strategy Interface
```python
# strategy_interface.py
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class TradingStrategy(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, data):
        pass
